# pynlg

``pynlg`` is a pure python re-implementation of [SimpleNLG-EnFr](https://github.com/rali-udem/SimpleNLG-EnFr), a java library enabling bilingual [text surface realisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realization_%28linguistics%29), based on [SimpleNLG](https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg).

``pynlg`` supports Python2.7 and 3.4. Python 3.3 should work, but is untested.

## Examples

TODO

## Supported languages
For now, the following languages are supported:

- french (in process)
- english (in process)

## How can I contribute?

First, clone the repository, and create a new local branch. Once the new feature is implemented (or the bug is fixed) and everything is **tested** properly, push your work and create a pull request.

Note: you should run the tests beforehand, and make sure they pass:

```bash
$ tox
```
