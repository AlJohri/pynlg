pynlg
=====

``pynlg`` is a pure python re-implementation of `SimpleNLG-EnFr <https://github.com/rali-udem/SimpleNLG-EnFr>`_, a java library enabling bilingual `text surface realisation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realization_%28linguistics%29>`_, based on `SimpleNLG <https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg>`_.

``pynlg`` supports Python2.7 and 3.4. Python 3.3 should work, but is untested.

Supported languages
--------------------

For now, the following languages are supported:

- french (in process)
- english (in process)

How can I contribute?
---------------------

First, clone the repository, and create a new local branch. Once the new feature is implemented (or the bug is fixed) and everything is **tested** properly, push your work and create a pull request.

Note: you should run the tests beforehand, and make sure they pass:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox


How do I add support for a new language?
----------------------------------------
